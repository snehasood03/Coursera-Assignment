				So now we're ready to embark on actually doing the main content of the page. And what we're going to start with is this giant picture of the restaurant, of the interior of the restaurant, which is actually what's called the Jumbotron in bootstrap speak. However before we start, we're going to have to define some element that is going to be a container for everything that is inside of our website. And that's simply because remember, we put in the container our header and we want everything nicely aligned to its edges. So we need a top level element within our main content to have a container class assigned to it. Let's go ahead and start with that. Let's go back to code editor, let's open up the index.html that is located at this point in the examples lecture 34 after folder. And we'll go ahead and scroll down right below our cold button right here and we'll open up another DIV. We'll say div.container and we'll press tab and that's the emit plug-in that's helping me do this. And we'll actually give it even an ID so that way later it will be much easier for us to target it. We'll call it main-content. Main-content. Okay, so here's out main content, and now we're ready to code up our jumbotron. Well the way we're going to code our Jumbotron is we have a whole bunch of images in the Images folder. As you can see, jumbotron, they all are sized very differently. The first one is 768, that one is 768 pixels wide. Then there's jumbotron 992. That one is 992 pixels wide, and finally the 1200 one is the biggest one there. And obviously what we want from this is, to be able to substitute
